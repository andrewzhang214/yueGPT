# yueGPT
This is all of the code for the infrastructure surrounding yueGPT, a mini version of GPT that's meant to be trained on classical chinese (文言文).

This is mostly meant as a didactic exercise for myself, but seeing it (kinda) speak ancient Chinese is also fun.

The model architecture is based off the implementation in the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/kCc8FmEb1nY?si=y3iDRUCW49K8AaOR), however boilerplate code has been added for better training.
