# yueGPT
This is all of the code for the infrastructure surrounding yueGPT, a mini version of GPT that's meant to be trained on classical chinese (文言文).

This is mostly meant as a didactic exercise for myself, but seeing it (kinda) speak ancient Chinese is also fun.

The model architecture is based off the implementation in the video below, however some boilerplate code has been added for better training.
